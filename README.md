## I want to Contribute

### Local Development
This site uses Jekyll. There are multiple ways to install and run Jekyll:
 1. The easiest way is using the Jekyll docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll/). There is a [Makefile](./Makefile) in this repository which uses the docker image
    - Make sure you have [Docker service](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running
    - Simply run `make start` and start developing
 1. If you don't want to use the docker image, you can install Jekyll as a gem by following [this doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
    - Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to get the site running locally
 1. If you want to use Bundler to add Jekyll to your project, follow [this doc](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/using-jekyll-with-bundler/) instead
    - Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to get the site running locally
